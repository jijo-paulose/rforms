RForms, short for RDF Forms, is a javascript library that provides a way to edit and present RDF in form like interfaces. RForms relies on a templating mechanism, RForms-templates, to specify the RDF structures to edit/present and how the form should look like including labels, help texts, order, cardinality, grouping/sections, stylesheeting etc.

The RForms library also provides an javascript RDF API based on the RDF/JSON format.

RForms is a rewrite of the SHAME library where the templating mechanism has been simplified without loosing expressiveness.

Please see the [features](Features.md) or read the [introduction](Overview.md) to get a better feeling for what RForms can offer. You should also take a look at the online [demoes](Demo.md) and check out the [tutorial](Tutorial.md).
