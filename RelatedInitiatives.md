# RDF in Javascript #
## [rdfquery](http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/) ##
Is a jquery plugin that allows processing of RDF.
It does not provide any specific editing capabilities in itself.

## [RDF/JSON](http://docs.api.talis.com/platform-api/output-types/rdf-json) ##
The RDF/JSON format is a simple JSON representation of RDF. One of the most important characteristics is that every set of RDF triples have only one representation in RDF/JSON. This makes the syntax a bit verbose and clunky in some situations, however, it is easy to work with from within javascript.
