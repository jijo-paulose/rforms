#sidebar Menu

The following demo is the same as discussed in the [Tutorial tutorial]. Technically speaking it is a small javascript application included in the rForms library. The application allows you to switch between the raw RDF data, rForms presenter view, rForms editor view, and the rFormsTemplate used for generating the two views. Furthermore, the javascript application is embedded in this google page as a !OpenSocial gadget to overcome limitations of the google code wiki and cross-origin restrictions for loading data in javascript applications.

See subpages of this page for more demos.
