RForms - RDF FORMS
===================
RDF Forms is a javascript library that provides a way to declarative
describe how editors and presentation views of RDF should look like. 
The configuration mechanism elliminates the need for programming once the 
library has been deployed into an environment. The RDF/JSON format is
supported natively in the client.

RForms was previously known as SHAME.


INSTALLATION
===================
Before you can run any of the samples you have to make sure you have 
downloaded and build dojo. Simply run:
lib/INSTALL-dojo.sh

If you want to run any of the built versions, i.e. versions that load rforms
as a single minified file, you need to build RForms first, this is done by:
build/build.sh

NOTE: You have to either access rforms via a webserver or follow the DEVELOPMENT
instructions below for running the samples. To clarify even further, accessing:
"file:///path_to_rforms_trunk/samples/some_example.html"
is not possible unless of course you have followed the instructions under 
DEVELOPMENT. The reason is simply that the framework that RForms relies on
loads files via XHR requests, which is not allowed by default over file:///.


DEVELOPMENT
===================
It is recommended to experiment directly with non-built versions
as it gives you very good debugging and inspection tools to understand what is
going on (especially firebug in firefox and the built in debugging tools in 
Chrome). Furthermore, you do not have to deploy the rforms library on a web 
server, you can point your browser to the sample directory using file: address,
for instance file:///path_to_rforms_trunk/samples/editorView.html
But due to the ajax approach for loading dependencies you first have to allow
your browser to do ajax request from a file url, in Firefox this is done by:
1) go into the config mode by typing about:config in the locationbar.
2) search and change the security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false.

In Chrome this is done by starting the browser with the following flag:
 --allow-file-access-from-files
